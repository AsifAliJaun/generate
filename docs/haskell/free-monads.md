# Free Monads



## Free monads split monadic computations into data structures and interpreters


For instance, a computation involving commands to read and write from the prompt:

First we describe the "commands" of our computation as a Functor data type

```hs
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveFunctor #-}

data TeletypeF next
    = PrintLine String next
    | ReadLine (String -> next)
    deriving Functor

```

Then we use `Free` to create the "Free Monad over `TeletypeF`" and build some basic operations.

```hs
import Control.Monad.Free (Free, liftF, iterM)

type Teletype = Free TeletypeF

printLine :: String -> Teletype ()
printLine str = liftF (PrintLine str ())

readLine :: Teletype String
readLine = liftF (ReadLine id)

```

Since `Free f` is a `Monad` whenever `f` is a `Functor`, we can use the standard `Monad` combinators (including `do` notation) to build `Teletype` computations.

```hs
import Control.Monad -- we can use the standard combinators

echo :: Teletype ()
echo = readLine >>= printLine

mockingbird :: Teletype a
mockingbird = forever echo

```

Finally, we write an "interpreter" turning `Teletype a` values into something we know how to work with like `IO a`

```hs
interpretTeletype :: Teletype a -> IO a
interpretTeletype = foldFree run where
  run :: TeletypeF a -> IO a
  run (PrintLine str x) = (putStrLn str ) *> return x
  run (ReadLine f) = fmap f getLine

```

Which we can use to "run" the `Teletype a` computation in `IO`

```hs
> interpretTeletype mockingbird
hello
hello
goodbye
goodbye
this will go on forever
this will go on forever

```



## The Freer monad


There's an alternative formulation of the free monad called the Freer (or Prompt, or Operational) monad. The Freer monad doesn't require a Functor instance for its underlying instruction set, and it has a more recognisably list-like structure than the standard free monad.

The Freer monad represents programs as a sequence of atomic **instructions** belonging to the instruction set `i :: * -> *`. Each instruction uses its parameter to declare its return type. For example, the set of base instructions for the `State` monad are as follows:

```hs
data StateI s a where
    Get :: StateI s s  -- the Get instruction returns a value of type 's'
    Put :: s -> StateI s ()  -- the Put instruction contains an 's' as an argument and returns ()

```

Sequencing these instructions takes place with the `:>>=` constructor. `:>>=` takes a single instruction returning an `a` and prepends it to the rest of the program, piping its return value into the continuation. In other words, given an instruction returning an `a`, and a function to turn an `a` into a program returning a `b`, `:>>=` will produce a program returning a `b`.

```hs
data Freer i a where
    Return :: a -> Freer i a
    (:>>=) :: i a -> (a -> Freer i b) -> Freer i b

```

Note that `a` is existentially quantified in the `:>>=` constructor. The only way for an interpreter to learn what `a` is is by pattern matching on the GADT `i`.

> 
<p>**Aside**: The co-Yoneda lemma tells us that `Freer` is isomorphic to `Free`.
Recall the definition of the `CoYoneda` functor:</p>

```hs
data CoYoneda i b where
  CoYoneda :: i a -> (a -> b) -> CoYoneda i b

```


`Freer i` is equivalent to `Free (CoYoneda i)`. If you take [`Free`'s constructors](http://stackoverflow.com/documentation/haskell/1290/free-monads/10159/free-monads-are-like-fixed-points#t=201704251552288375042) and set `f ~ CoYoneda i`, you get:

```hs
Pure :: a -> Free (CoYoneda i) a
Free :: CoYoneda i (Free (CoYoneda i) b) -> Free (CoYonda i) b ~
        i a -> (a -> Free (CoYoneda i) b) -> Free (CoYoneda i) b

```


<p>from which we can recover `Freer i`'s constructors by just setting
`Freer i ~ Free (CoYoneda i)`.</p>


Because `CoYoneda i` is a `Functor` for any `i`, `Freer` is a `Monad` for any `i`, even if `i` isn't a `Functor`.

```hs
instance Monad (Freer i) where
    return = Return
    Return x >>= f = f x
    (i :>>= g) >>= f = i :>>= fmap (>>= f) g  -- using `(->) r`'s instance of Functor, so fmap = (.)

```

Interpreters can be built for `Freer` by mapping instructions to some handler monad.

```hs
foldFreer :: Monad m => (forall x. i x -> m x) -> Freer i a -> m a
foldFreer eta (Return x) = return x
foldFreer eta (i :>>= f) = eta i >>= (foldFreer eta . f)

```

For example, we can interpret the `Freer (StateI s)` monad using the regular `State s` monad as a handler:

```hs
runFreerState :: Freer (StateI s) a -> s -> (a, s)
runFreerState = State.runState . foldFreer toState
    where toState :: StateI s a -> State s a
          toState Get = State.get
          toState (Put x) = State.put x

```



## Free Monads are like fixed points


Compare the definition of `Free` to that of [`Fix`](http://stackoverflow.com/documentation/haskell/2984/recursion-schemes/10136/fixed-points#t=201607231205277560464):

```hs
data Free f a = Return a
              | Free (f (Free f a))

newtype Fix f = Fix { unFix :: f (Fix f) }

```

In particular, compare the type of the `Free` constructor with the type of the `Fix` constructor. `Free` layers up a functor just like `Fix`, except that `Free` has an additional `Return a` case.



## How do foldFree and iterM work?


There are some functions to help tear down `Free` computations by interpreting them into another monad `m`: `iterM :: (Functor f, Monad m) => (f (m a) -> m a) -> (Free f a -> m a)` and `foldFree :: Monad m => (forall x. f x -> m x) -> (Free f a -> m a)`. What are they doing?

First let's see what it would take to tear down an interpret a `Teletype a` function into `IO` manually. We can see `Free f a` as being defined

```hs
data Free f a 
    = Pure a 
    | Free (f (Free f a))

```

The `Pure` case is easy:

```hs
interpretTeletype :: Teletype a -> IO a
interpretTeletype (Pure x) = return x
interpretTeletype (Free teletypeF) = _

```

Now, how to interpret a `Teletype` computation that was built with the `Free` constructor? We'd like to arrive at a value of type `IO a` by examining `teletypeF :: TeletypeF (Teletype a)`. To start with, we'll write a function `runIO :: TeletypeF a -> IO a` which maps a single layer of the free monad to an `IO` action:

```hs
runIO :: TeletypeF a -> IO a
runIO (PrintLine msg x) = putStrLn msg *> return x
runIO (ReadLine k) = fmap k getLine

```

Now we can use `runIO` to fill in the rest of `interpretTeletype`. Recall that `teletypeF :: TeletypeF (Teletype a)` is a layer of the `TeletypeF` functor which contains the rest of the `Free` computation. We'll use `runIO` to interpret the outermost layer (so we have `runIO teletypeF :: IO (Teletype a)`) and then use the `IO` monad's `>>=` combinator to interpret the returned `Teletype a`.

```hs
interpretTeletype :: Teletype a -> IO a
interpretTeletype (Pure x) = return x
interpretTeletype (Free teletypeF) = runIO teletypeF >>= interpretTeletype

```

The definition of `foldFree` is just that of `interpretTeletype`, except that the `runIO` function has been factored out. As a result, `foldFree` works independently of any particular base functor and of any target monad.

```hs
foldFree :: Monad m => (forall x. f x -> m x) -> Free f a -> m a
foldFree eta (Pure x) = return x
foldFree eta (Free fa) = eta fa >>= foldFree eta

```

`foldFree` has a rank-2 type: `eta` is a natural transformation. We could have given `foldFree` a type of `Monad m => (f (Free f a) -> m (Free f a)) -> Free f a -> m a`, but that gives `eta` the liberty of inspecting the `Free` computation inside the `f` layer. Giving `foldFree` this more restrictive type ensures that `eta` can only process a single layer at a time.

`iterM` does give the folding function the ability to examine the subcomputation. The (monadic) result of the previous iteration is available to the next, inside `f`'s parameter. `iterM` is analogous to a [**paramorphism**](http://stackoverflow.com/documentation/haskell/2984/recursion-schemes/13192/general-recursion#t=20161231003345211125) whereas `foldFree` is like a [**catamorphism**](http://stackoverflow.com/documentation/haskell/2984/recursion-schemes/10137/folding-up-a-structure-one-layer-at-a-time#t=20161231003345211125).

```hs
iterM :: (Monad m, Functor f) => (f (m a) -> m a) -> Free f a -> m a
iterM phi (Pure x) = return x
iterM phi (Free fa) = phi (fmap (iterM phi) fa)

```
