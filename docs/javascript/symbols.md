# Symbols



## Basics of symbol primitive type


`Symbol` is a new primitive type in ES6. Symbols are used mainly as **property keys**, and one of its main characteristics is that they are **unique**, even if they have the same description. This means they will never have a name clash with any other property key that is a `symbol` or `string`.

```js
const MY_PROP_KEY = Symbol();
const obj = {};

obj[MY_PROP_KEY] = "ABC";
console.log(obj[MY_PROP_KEY]); 

```

In this example, the result of `console.log` would be `ABC`.

You can also have named Symbols like:

```js
const APPLE    = Symbol('Apple');
const BANANA   = Symbol('Banana');
const GRAPE    = Symbol('Grape');

```

Each of these values are unique and cannot be overridden.

Providing an optional parameter `(description)` when creating primitive symbols  can be used for debugging but not to access the symbol itself (but see the [`Symbol.for()`](http://stackoverflow.com/documentation/javascript/2764/symbols/19176/using-symbol-for-to-create-global-shared-symbols) example for a way to register/lookup global shared symbols).



## Using Symbol.for() to create global, shared symbols


The `Symbol.for` method allows you to register and look up global symbols by name. The first time it is called with a given key, it creates a new symbol and adds it to the registry.

```js
let a = Symbol.for('A');

```

The next time you call `Symbol.for('A')`, the **same symbol** will be returned instead of a new one (in contrast to `Symbol('A')` which would create a new, unique symbol that happens to have the same description).

```js
a === Symbol.for('A') // true

```

but

```js
a === Symbol('A') // false

```



## Converting a symbol into a string


Unlike most other JavaScript objects, symbols are not automatically converted into a string when performing concatenation.

```js
let apple = Symbol('Apple') + ''; // throws TypeError!

```

Instead, they have to be explicitly converted into a string when necessary, (for example, to get a textual description of the symbol that can be used in a debug message) using the `toString` method or the `String` constructor.

```js
const APPLE = Symbol('Apple');
let str1 = APPLE.toString(); // "Symbol(Apple)"
let str2 = String(APPLE);    // "Symbol(Apple)"

```



#### Syntax


- Symbol()
- Symbol(description)
- Symbol.toString()
